# Cross-Platform Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the approach for developing a system that supports:
- Web browsers
- Android devices
- iOS devices

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Option 1: React Native + React Native Web
- **Core Technology**: React Native
- **Web Support**: React Native Web
- **Advantages**:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript codebase
  - Large ecosystem and community
  - Reuse most code across platforms
  - Compatible with existing web technologies
  - Good integration with existing web components

### Option 2: Flutter
- **Core Technology**: Flutter
- **Advantages**:
  - Single codebase for all platforms
  - High performance
  - Rich UI components
  - Strong typing with Dart

## Project Structure

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── api/               # Shared API services
│   ├── assets/            # Images, fonts, etc.
│   ├── components/        # Shared UI components
│   ├── hooks/             # Custom hooks
│   ├── navigation/        # Navigation structure
│   ├── screens/           # Main app screens
│   ├── store/             # State management
│   └── utils/             # Utility functions
├── platform/
│   ├── web/               # Web-specific code
│   ├── android/           # Android-specific code
│   └── ios/               # iOS-specific code
├── docs/                  # Documentation
└── tests/                 # Test files
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Install necessary SDKs (Android Studio, Xcode)
   - Configure development tools

2. **Create Project Foundation**
   - Initialize project with chosen framework
   - Setup basic navigation structure
   - Implement design system

3. **Develop Core Features**
   - Implement shared business logic
   - Create reusable components
   - Build API services

4. **Platform-Specific Adaptations**
   - Optimize UI for each platform
   - Implement platform-specific features

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests
   - Platform-specific testing

6. **Deployment**
   - Web deployment
   - App store submissions

## Blockchain Integration Considerations

Given your existing project's focus on tokens and blockchain:

- Use libraries like ethers.js or web3.js that work across platforms
- Implement secure key storage appropriate for each platform
- Consider platform-specific differences in deep linking
- Use responsive design for transaction viewing

## Next Steps

1. Choose between React Native or Flutter based on team expertise
2. Set up the initial project structure
3. Migrate existing web functionality to the new codebase
4. Implement platform-specific features
